"""Persist the full corpus extraction to ``corpus/pages.jsonl``.

Pipeline stage: reads ``corpus/manifest.yaml``, calls
:func:`extract_pdf.extract_doc` on each declared document, and streams the
resulting :class:`~extract_pdf.Page` records — one JSON object per line —
into ``corpus/pages.jsonl``. The chunking stage consumes this file, not
pdfplumber, so PDF parsing is paid once and the extracted text becomes
independently auditable.

Design intent
-------------
- **Two-stage pipeline (persist between extraction and chunking)** — the
  chunker must not re-open PDFs. A single artifact on disk means:
  extraction regressions are machine-detectable via SHA256 (see below);
  the ``guide-hygiene.pdf`` documented limit stays inspectable at rest;
  chunking has a stable byte-for-byte input.
- **Committed baseline with SHA256 gelé au manifest** — symmetric to
  REQ-CORPUS-01 (PDF SHA256). ``corpus/pages.jsonl`` is versioned AND
  its SHA256 is declared in ``corpus/manifest.yaml`` under
  ``derived_artifacts.pages_jsonl.sha256``; a silent drift (including
  a text-only drift that leaves counts and ordering intact) fails
  ``test_baseline_hash_matches_manifest`` without depending on a
  human running ``git diff``. Materializes REQ-CORPUS-04
  machine-enforced end-to-end.
- **Deterministic output** — manifest order for documents, 1-indexed
  ``page_num`` for pages, JSON keys emitted in ``(doc_id, page_num, text)``
  order, ``ensure_ascii=False`` so French text stays readable in ``git
  diff``, LF line endings forced by ``newline="\n"`` and pinned across
  platforms by ``.gitattributes``. Two runs on the same corpus, same
  ``pdfplumber`` version, must produce byte-identical files.
- **Atomic write via ``.tmp`` sidecar** — same idiom as
  ``download_corpus.fetch``. A crash mid-run leaves the previous
  ``pages.jsonl`` intact; downstream never observes a truncated JSONL.

Upstream requirements (see ``docs/REQUIREMENTS.md``)
---------------------------------------------------
- **REQ-CORPUS-02** — Page-count invariant. Enforced transitively:
  :func:`extract_pdf.extract_doc` refuses to emit Pages if the actual
  count diverges from the manifest, so any line written here already
  satisfies ``page_num <= manifest.pages(doc_id)``.
- **REQ-CORPUS-04** — Persisted extraction baseline, SHA256 gelé au
  manifest. Materialized by the committed ``corpus/pages.jsonl`` and
  its declared hash under ``derived_artifacts.pages_jsonl.sha256``.
  Bit-for-bit regression — including text-only drift — detected by
  ``test_baseline_hash_matches_manifest`` (machine-enforced) and
  by ``git diff`` (human-readable).

Exit codes
----------
``0`` on success (file written or already up-to-date), ``1`` on any
extraction failure (unknown doc_id, missing PDF, page-count mismatch,
empty extraction). Errors are aggregated per document rather than
fail-fast, so a single run inventories every violation.
